Welcome to my Github profile! My name is Ankush Punit Baskey, and I am currently studying at IISER Kolkata. I am passionate about astrophysics and ethical hacking, and I have a deep interest in exploring the mysteries of the universe and the human mind.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I also have a passion for music and game. I play the guitar and have achieved state-level proficiency in chess. These activities help me unwind and find inspiration for my research.

One area that I am particularly interested in exploring is the topic of consciousness. Recently, I came across Peter Matthiessen's Nine-Headed Dragon River, which explores the mysteries of consciousness and the human mind. This book has inspired me to delve deeper into this topic, and I am excited to see where my research takes me.

At the same time, I believe that studying human behavior is one of the most interesting and rewarding things one can do. Our behavior, thoughts, and emotions are endlessly fascinating and complex. By understanding these aspects of ourselves and others, we can better navigate the world around us and create a better society for all.

In conclusion, I hope you find my Github repository useful and informative. I am always looking for new opportunities to collaborate with fellow researchers and developers, so please feel free to reach out to me if you would like to learn more about my work or collaborate on a project. Thank you for visiting!
